This repository contains demos for my session on [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) (distributed application runtime) for [Global Azure Bootcamp 2021 event](https://globalazure.net/). Talk is in Slovenian language as part of Slovenian Azure User Group initiative.

Demos are built in different branches to separate the concepts:
1. starting with hello-dapr examples in branch hello-dapr
2. continuing with building blocks examples in branch building-blocks
3. continuing with Kubernetes examples in branch kubernetes-deployments
4. finishing with integration examples in branch integration

All demos are simple to prove the concepts, main features and capabilities.
